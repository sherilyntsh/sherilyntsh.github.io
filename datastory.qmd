The data story that I will be telling is about the top 100 most popular dog breeds and their respective characteristics as to why they are the most popular.

# Data Table

First, let us look at the selected data set and it's respective rows and columns. Read the description of the different variables before clicking the 'Table'. This table is interactive and you can choose to see the different dog breed groups and also change the ranges of the different variables at the side bar. Time for you to explore!
