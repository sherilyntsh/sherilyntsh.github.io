The data story that I will be telling is about the top 100 most popular dog breeds and their respective characteristics as to why they are the most popular.

## Data Table

First, let us look at the selected data set and it's respective rows and columns. Read the description of the different variables before clicking the 'Table'. This table is interactive and you can choose to see the different dog breed groups and also change the ranges of the different variables at the side bar. Time for you to explore! 

Looking at this table, it is hard to see any trends or patterns. To analyse the patterns and trends in out data set, click on the 'Data Visualization' tab to look at the different plots.
