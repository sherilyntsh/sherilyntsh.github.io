# Introduction

Welcome to Sherilyn's GitHub! Here is where all the progress of my work from NM2207 will be kept and also my final project. The data story that I have decided to work on is about dogs. I am going to investigate what contributes to the popularity of dog breeds based on their different traits.

# Data Set
