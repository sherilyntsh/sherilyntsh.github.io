Welcome to my website!

## Introduction

Welcome to Sherilyn's GitHub! Here is where all the progress of my work from NM2207 will be kept and also my final project. The data story that I have decided to work on is about dogs. I am going to create an app using shiny to help users to visualize which dog breed group is the most popular and why is that so.

## Data Set

The links to the data set can be found below:

akc data latest - <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/dog-breeds-dataset>

## Data Selection

I will be using the columns breeds, popularity, group, min_height, max_height, min_weight, max_weight, min_expectancy, max_expectancy, shedding_value, energy_level_value, trainability_value.

## Data Visualization

There will be 3 kinds of visualization.

1.  "**Table**" It is a table that shows users the whole data set of the top 100 dog breeds and also filter through the data set.

2.  "**Bar Chart**" It is a bar chart visualization to see the count of the the type of breeds there are in the top 100 most popular breeds and their respective characteristics.

3.  "**Violin Plot**" This violin plot visualization will show the distributions of the continuous variable characteristics of the all the different breed group. From the "Bar Chart" it can also be seen that the 'Working Group' is the most popular breed group in the top 100 thus from this violin plot we can see what characteristics is most common for this breed group.
