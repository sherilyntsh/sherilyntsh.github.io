# Introduction

Welcome to Sherilyn's GitHub! Here is where all the progress of my work from NM2207 will be kept and also my final project. The data story that I have decided to work on is about dogs. I am going to create an app using shiny to help users to figure out which dogs is best suited for them using the different characteristics and categories provided in the data set.
