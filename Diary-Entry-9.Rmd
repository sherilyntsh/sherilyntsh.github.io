## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### What is the question that you are going to answer?

How do I determine which dog breed is best suited for me?

### Why is this an important question?

According to the American Kennel Club, getting a dog should be a well-planned decision to ensure a lifelong commitment as dogs are not objects that can be returned if you change your mind because they have become too big, too energetic, or too time-consuming to care for properly. For the greatest chance for success, one must find a breed that will best fit their lifestyle, activity level, and living conditions.

### Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question?Â 

I will be using the data set "akc-data-latest". The columns I will be using is 'breeds', 'popularity', 'min_height', 'max_height', 'min_weight', 'max_weight', 'min_expectancy', 'max_expectancy', 'group', 'grooming_frequency_value', 'shedding_value', 'shedding_category', "energy_level_value', 'energy_level_category', 'trainability_value', 'trainability_category', 'demeanor_value', 'demeanor_category'.

### Potential Challenges & Errors

Some challenges I feel might surface when creating the Shiny App is that there might be too many variables in the data to create a meaningful visualization to answer the statement. Moreover, the data set I will be using has some empty columns thus cleaning up the data might be difficult as I might eliminate breeds that do not have sufficient data, limiting the breed choices for users.
