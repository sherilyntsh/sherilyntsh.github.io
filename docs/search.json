The data story that I have decided to work on is about dogs. I am going to investigate what contributes to the popularity of dog breeds based on their different traits.\n\n\nData Set\nThe links to the data set can be found below:\ndog intelligence - https://data.world/len/dog-size-intelligence-linked\nbreed rank - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/dog-breeds\ndog breeds - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/dog-breeds-details\nakc data latest - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/dog-breeds-dataset"

    "text": "Including Plots\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\nWhat is the question that you are going to answer?\nHow do I determine which dog breed is best suited for me?\n\n\nWhy is this an important question?\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, getting a dog should be a well-planned decision to ensure a lifelong commitment as dogs are not objects that can be returned if you change your mind because they have become too big, too energetic, or too time-consuming to care for properly. For the greatest chance for success, one must find a breed that will best fit their lifestyle, activity level, and living conditions.\n\n\nWhich rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question? \nI will be using the data set “akc-data-latest”. The columns I will be using is ‘breeds’, ‘popularity’, ‘min_height’, ‘max_height’, ‘min_weight’, ‘max_weight’, ‘min_expectancy’, ‘max_expectancy’, ‘group’, ‘grooming_frequency_value’, ‘shedding_value’, ‘shedding_category’, “energy_level_value’, ‘energy_level_category’, ‘trainability_value’, ‘trainability_category’, ‘demeanor_value’, ‘demeanor_category’.\n\n\nPotential Challenges & Errors\nSome challenges I feel might surface when creating the Shiny App is that there might be too many variables in the data to create a meaningful visualization to answer the statement. Moreover, the data set I will be using has some empty columns thus cleaning up the data might be difficult as I might eliminate breeds that do not have sufficient data, limiting the breed choices for users."
