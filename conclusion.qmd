From the 'Data Visualization' tab, we can see that the '**Working Group**' has the highest count in the top 100 dog breeds. From the 'Table' tab, we can filter the 'Working Group' to see what different breeds there are. Some of the breeds under the 'Working Group' are Rottweiler, Boxer, Siberian Husky and Great Dane. Then, to determine the characteristics of the 'Working Group', we will use the bar chart from the 'Data Visualization'. From the side bar, we can change the variables to determine the characteristic. From there, the characteristics are as such; **0.6 seasonal shedding value**, **0.8 energetic energy level** and **0.6 agreeable training value**. Next, from the violin plot, we can see the spread of continuous variables. The violin plot shows that most of the dogs in the 'Working Group' has a **mean height** of **64cm** as seen from the central tendency of the plot, while the **mean weight** has an even spread ranging from **0kg to 80kg**. Lastly, we can see that the **mean expectancy** from the violin plot has its central tendency towards **9 years**.

However, having 0kg within the mean weight range seems impossible and it may be due to an error in the data set. Going back to the 'Table' and filtering out the 'Working Group' breeds, we can see that the breed 'Cane Corso' has a mean weight of 0kg. This error in the data may be due to the main data set not having the value as the current data set is extrapolated from the main data set. In order to avoid such errors next time, we can code it such that on top of disregarding the N.A. values, we can set a numerical filter that values must be above 0.
